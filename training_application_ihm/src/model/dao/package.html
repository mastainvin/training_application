  Provides all dao objects from database.
  <br/>
  For every object in the business logic package we provide an interface made to interact with the database.
  For exemple {@link model.dao.TrainingDao} is an interface which can create, update, delete, and get a training from the 
  data base. We don't have to know how the database his made. His implementation {@link model.dao.TrainingDaoImpl} made the sql request,
  but if maybe one day a no-sql database. We'll just have to add another implemation for all the interface.
